To run, clone the repo and add a data.js file. Data.js should have the following content:
```
var data = `<csv data of bank statement>`;
```
Note the backtick quotes used for multi line string. Also, data should not have any empty lines or the column headings.

You can add groups in main.js by adding them to `var groups`.

## TODO:
* React native
* Plaid Integration
* Refactor to use ES6 modules
* Dynamically add groups
